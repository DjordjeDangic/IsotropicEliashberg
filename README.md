# Solver for isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations

This simple code will allow you to calculate superconducting critical temperature using isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The phonon quasiparticles are renormalized by anharmonicity and calculated using Stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA).
